# Android Data Binding with nested Recycler View (JetPack)
This is a sample repo to show how to use the Android Jetpack announced in the Google I/O 2018 with Android Data Binding.

The app uses the MVVM Architecture. I have used the following components for development:

  * Room - For offline data persistence
  * LiveData - Handle data in a lifecycle-aware fashion
  * ViewModel - Manage your UI's data in a lifecycle-aware fashion
  * DataBinding - minimize the glue code necessary to bind your application logic and layouts.
  * Java 8 support - added lambda support
  * Nested Recycler View
